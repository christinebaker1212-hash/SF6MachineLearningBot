# SF6 Machine Learning Bot — project notes for Claude and the user

Experimental ML agent for Street Fighter 6. **Long-term goal: Master rank.** That goal is an
experimental outcome we're working toward, not a promised capability.

## Status
- **Current milestone: 1 (game connection).** The code is complete. It is tested only against
  MOCK capture/input in a Linux container. **It has not run against the real game yet.**
- Next step: the user runs the M1 acceptance procedure below on the game PC and sends back the
  `report.md`, `acceptance_checklist.md` files and `sysinfo` output.

## User setup and constraints
| item | value | source |
|---|---|---|
| OS / platform | Windows 11, Steam | user |
| Device | ROG Xbox Ally X handheld, with a keyboard connected | user |
| CPU | AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme, 8 cores / 16 threads | `sysinfo` |
| GPU / VRAM | AMD Radeon 890M iGPU, 12117 MB reported as dedicated (shared with system memory). **No CUDA.** | `sysinfo` |
| RAM | 11.6 GB visible to Windows | `sysinfo` |
| Display | 1920x1080 @ 60 Hz, single monitor | `sysinfo` |
| Python | 3.14.5 | `sysinfo` |
| SF6 window | `StreetFighter6.exe`, title "Street Fighter 6", **windowed 1280x720** client at (479,192) | `list-windows` |
| Character / controls | Ryu, Classic | user |
| Input method | keyboard via SendInput (scancodes) | user |
| REFramework | available | user |

**Fixed constraint: ranked starts at Diamond or above.** The user's account, and any account
they have, cannot queue below Diamond. No alt account will be used.
- The ranked milestone therefore needs offline evidence of roughly Diamond-level play first:
  CPU, the Model Trainer (Master), and consenting players.
- The first ranked games are a high-stakes test on the user's real account.
- Ranked deployment remains a separate milestone, gated on checking Capcom/Steam rules for
  automated play and mods.

**Requirement: opponent assessment (planned for M2–M4, recorded here so it isn't lost).**
The agent should notice opponent mistakes and judge whether the opponent is below its level.
Examples of mistakes: whiffed or badly spaced normals, unsafe moves on block, missed
punishes, missed anti-airs, poor drive/burnout management, slow reactions.
- **Plan:** M2 detectors produce per-match evidence.
- An estimator outputs P(opponent weaker than agent) with uncertainty. It is calibrated on
  labelled matches: CPU levels, the user's play, and the Model Trainer.
- That estimate is a policy input and a risk/aggression setting, learned in RL against
  opponents of mixed strength.
- **Guardrails:**
  - Confidence only rises with enough evidence.
  - It resets each match.
  - It decays fast after the agent gets punished, so baiting or sandbagging is costly.
- **Evaluation:** classification accuracy on held-out matches, plus win-rate change against
  weaker and stronger opponents.
- **Dependency:** reliable hit/whiff/block detection. Screen-only detection is hard; the
  REFramework state read is the likely route.

**Requirement: match commentary ("thinking" feed) — user request.**
The overlay has a THOUGHTS strip (`Session.narrate`). The user wants it to describe, in
natural language:
- neutral and spacing
- move choice
- the opponent's state and habits
- what the bot is doing and what the opponent is doing

Rules:
- **Local and template-based.** No remote LLM in the game loop. A local LLM is too heavy for
  the Ally X alongside SF6.
- **Every line is tagged with its source**, so a post-hoc description is never presented as the
  model's reasoning:
  - `[scripted]` for M1 routines
  - `[measured]` for M2 detector/REFramework state, with confidence
  - `[policy]` for the model's actual outputs: action probabilities, value estimate, the
    opponent-assessment estimate
- **Grounded in internal structure.** Explicit spacing zones, an opponent model, and value/risk
  estimates as policy inputs and outputs make the commentary describe real internals rather
  than guesses.

Layout: the overlay sits at the hard left of the screen, inputs panel leftmost, then the frame
view, with the THOUGHTS strip underneath.

## Sending results to Claude
Menu option **S** (`sf6bot share`) writes `runs\for_claude.txt` and copies it to the
clipboard. It contains the reports, checklists and notable events of the last 6 runs (a few
KB). Videos stay on the PC. There is no Google Drive connector in this Claude session.

## Feasibility assessment (concise)
**Verified (documentation / library source, not yet on the user's PC):**
- dxcam 0.3.0 provides Desktop Duplication capture. Per-frame `LastPresentTime` is in QPC
  ticks and exposed as seconds; I read this in the library source.
- `SendInput` with scancodes and a `dwExtraInfo` tag is a documented Win32 API.
- The SF6 window and process are found via EnumWindows. **Verified on the user's PC:**
  `StreetFighter6.exe`, title "Street Fighter 6".

**Not assumed:**
- No official SF6 training API.
- No deterministic frame stepping, no faster-than-real-time simulation.
- No save states, no parallel instances.
- Training is real-time on one game instance: at most 60 decisions per second, and resets cost
  wall-clock seconds.

**Implications:**
- Pixel-only RL from scratch needs on the order of 10^7+ steps. At 60 Hz that is roughly 46+
  hours of continuous play per 10^7 steps, plus resets.
- Expect to rely heavily on demonstrations / behaviour cloning, compact state features, and
  macro actions (short sequences).

**REFramework (high-value, unverified):** Lua scripts can read in-game state. The community
has written SF6 hitbox and frame-data viewers. This could give exact HP, positions, facing, hit
states and a game frame counter, i.e. ground truth for M2 and frame-level timing checks.
- To verify in M2: current game patch compatibility, the exact fields, and a way to export
  them to Python (file, socket or shared memory).
- Keep it offline-only until ranked rules are checked.

**Master rank:** a top-human-level fighting game agent trained from real-time play on a single
instance is an open research problem. No outcome is promised.

## Architecture (Milestone 1)
```
FrameGrabber thread (capture.py)  --newest frame-->  ControlLoop / SequenceRunner (loop.py, sequences.py)
  dxcam | mss | MOCK synthetic                         policy (policy.py: IDLE / RANDOM / PROBE, none learned)
        |                                                 |
        v                                                 v
SessionRecorder thread (recorder.py)  <--events--  Controller (controller.py) --SendInput--> SF6
  frames.csv, video.mp4, events.jsonl                 held-key tracking, facing mirroring, release_all
        ^                                                 ^
        |                                     Watchdog thread (safety.py): kill F8, pause F7, flip F6,
DebugOverlay thread (overlay.py)              focus loss -> disarm+release, window moved/closed -> stop
```
- `session.py` wires everything up and guarantees teardown: release inputs, flush files, write
  the report. That happens on normal exit, exceptions, Ctrl+C, console close, crashed threads
  and atexit.
- `report.py` builds `report.md` / `report.json` from a run directory (re-runnable).
- `latency_probe.py` measures input → visible change (e.g. the Training Mode input display).
- `acceptance.py` runs the scripted M1 routine from `configs/acceptance.yaml`.
- Config:
  - `configs/default.yaml` is the default config.
  - `configs/local.yaml` (git-ignored) holds personal overrides, e.g. key bindings.
  - `configs/sequences/ryu_classic.yaml` holds the moves.
- Sequence notation: `<dir>[+BTN...][@frames]`, with directions in numpad notation relative to
  facing. Example: Hadoken = `2@3 3@3 6+LP@3`.
- Timing: steps are scheduled on wall-clock at `t0 + frames/60`. They are **not** synced to game
  frames.
- Facing in M1 is set manually (`--side`, or F6 to flip at runtime). Detection comes in M2.

## Commands
### Install without typing commands (recommended for the user)
1. Download the branch ZIP from
   https://github.com/christinebaker1212-hash/SF6MachineLearningBot/archive/refs/heads/claude/admiring-mccarthy-uyyay4.zip
   and extract it.
2. Double-click `setup.bat` once.
3. Double-click `menu.bat` and choose steps by number.
4. To get new versions, double-click `update.bat`. It keeps `.venv`, `runs` and
   `configs\local.yaml`. If the download fails (e.g. the repo is private), download the ZIP
   manually and copy its contents over the folder.

Results land in `runs\` (menu option 0 opens it).

### Install (Windows 11, PowerShell)
```powershell
winget install Python.Python.3.12
git clone https://github.com/christinebaker1212-hash/SF6MachineLearningBot.git
cd SF6MachineLearningBot
git checkout claude/admiring-mccarthy-uyyay4
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e ".[windows,dev]"
# Optional, for `run --policy probe` (GPU inference timing): install the CUDA build of torch with the
# exact command from https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ (pick Stable / Windows / Pip / CUDA).
```
If `Activate.ps1` is blocked, run:
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`

### Dev / tests (any OS, MOCK only)
```
pip install -e ".[dev,mss]"
python -m pytest -q
python -m sf6bot --mock --no-overlay acceptance   # MOCK pipeline run, writes runs/*_MOCK
```

`sf6bot -h`. Global flags: `--mock`, `--no-overlay`, `--config`.

| command | purpose |
|---|---|
| `sysinfo` | Print OS, CPU, GPU, VRAM, RAM and display info |
| `list-windows` | Show which window matches SF6 |
| `capture-bench --seconds 20` | Capture only, no inputs; report plus `snapshot.png` |
| `input-test --seq "6@30"` or `--move hadoken_lp --repeat 10 --side left` | Run one sequence |
| `acceptance --side left` / `--side right` | The M1 routine |
| `latency-probe --roi x,y,w,h` | Input → visible-change latency |
| `run --policy idle\|random\|probe --seconds 60` | Live loop |
| `report runs/<dir>` | Rebuild a report |
| `release-all` | Send key-up for all bound keys, for a stuck key after a hard kill |

## M1 acceptance procedure (user, on the game PC)
1. **Game settings:**
   - Display mode: **Borderless or Windowed** on the primary monitor. If it's on another
     monitor, set `capture.output_idx`.
   - Keyboard is assigned to Player 1.
   - In Controls → Keyboard, the bindings match `input.bindings` in config. Defaults are
     W/A/S/D for directions and U I O / J K L for LP MP HP / LK MK HK. Alternatively, put the
     game's bindings in `configs/local.yaml`.
2. **Place the debug overlay where it doesn't cover the game,** or it will be captured.
3. **Run the setup checks:** `sf6bot sysinfo`, `sf6bot list-windows`, then
   `sf6bot capture-bench --seconds 20`. Do the capture bench in Training Mode and check
   `snapshot.png`.
4. **Set up Training Mode:** Ryu vs. a standing dummy, **input display ON**.
5. **Run the bound-input test:** `sf6bot input-test --seq "6@30"`. Click into the game during
   the 5 s countdown. Ryu should walk forward. Then try `--seq "4@30"` and `--seq "5+LP@3"`.
6. **Run the acceptance routine from both sides:**
   - `sf6bot acceptance --side left`.
   - Then put Ryu on the right using Training Mode's position reset, and run
     `sf6bot acceptance --side right`.
   - Fill in each run's `acceptance_checklist.md`. Count Hadokens out of 10 from the game,
     `video.mp4` or the input display.
7. **Measure latency with the probe** (a calibration measurement in Training Mode only; the
   bot never uses the input display during matches):
   - Run `sf6bot latency-probe` (menu option 7).
   - Drag a box around the newest row of the input display in the window it shows, then press
     ENTER. The box is printed, so it can be reused with `--roi`.
   - If presses are "not detected", adjust the ROI or `latency_probe.threshold`.
8. **Measure the live loop:** optional `sf6bot run --policy probe --seconds 60` (needs torch),
   and `sf6bot run --policy random --seconds 30`.
9. **Send back:** every `runs/*/report.md`, both checklists, and anything that looked wrong.

The safety tests are part of acceptance. During a run:
- Press **F8**: inputs must stop and release.
- Alt-Tab away: inputs must release.
- Press **F7**: pause and resume.

## Verified capabilities
| capability | MOCK/container | real SF6 |
|---|---|---|
| Capture with timestamps, duplicate/missed-frame counting | yes (synthetic) | **unverified** |
| SendInput press/release, atomic batches | yes (mock backend) | **unverified**. The user's first latency-probe run detected nothing on every trial; cause not yet known (input path vs. box/threshold). |
| Sequences with measured timing; facing mirroring | yes (unit tests) | **unverified** |
| Recording (frames.csv, video.mp4, events.jsonl) and report | yes | **unverified** |
| Kill/pause/focus-loss release | yes (unit tests) | **unverified** |
| Debug overlay (no-activate, topmost) | not testable headless | **unverified** |
| Latency probe logic | yes (reactive mock, known 50 ms delay) | **unverified** |
| PyTorch inference in loop | yes, torch 2.14.1 CPU in container (numbers not representative) | **unverified** (GPU) |

## Unresolved issues / risks
- **Key bindings:** SF6's default keyboard layout is not verified, so the user must align
  bindings.
- **Hardware limits (handheld, shared CPU and iGPU):**
  - Game, capture and inference compete for the same chip.
  - Inference runs on CPU (`loop.torch_threads: 2`). There is no CUDA, and ROCm/DirectML on
    Windows for the 890M is unverified.
  - Heavy training (BC/RL updates) will probably have to move to another machine or a cloud
    GPU, with only inference running on the handheld. Decide this from measured numbers.
  - RAM is about 11.6 GB with SF6 running.
  - Run plugged in, in the highest performance mode.
- **Kill switch:** a keyboard is connected, so F8 works. The controller kill switch (click both
  thumbsticks, `safety.pad_kill_combo`, read through XInput) is a backup. Whether the built-in
  pad shows up as XInput is unverified.
- **Which device controls Player 1:** the user reports that Ryu walks with keyboard input in
  Training Mode, so the keyboard does control P1. Whether this was the bot's `input-test` or a
  manual keypress is to be confirmed by the acceptance runs.
- **dxcam on SF6:** may fail in exclusive fullscreen; use borderless or windowed. The
  QPC-offset timestamp conversion is checked at runtime (`timestamp_check` in the report).
- **Short presses can be missed:** wall-clock timing means a 1-frame press can straddle game
  polling. `min_hold_frames: 2` is the default; the real reliability rate comes from the
  acceptance counts.
- **Stuck keys after a hard kill:** if the process is killed (e.g. Task Manager), keys may stay
  logically down. Use `sf6bot release-all`, or tap the keys.
- **Overlay over the game:** the overlay goes beside the game when there's room. It's also
  marked `WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE`, so it should not appear in captured frames even if it covers
  the game. This is unverified on the user's PC; check `snapshot.png`. The overlay status line
  shows "overlay in capture: hidden" or "VISIBLE".
- **Key-ups after focus loss:** on focus loss we send key-ups within about 5 ms, but they go
  to the newly focused window. We have not verified that SF6 clears held inputs when it loses
  focus.
  - Acceptance check: hold-walk, Alt-Tab, return. Ryu must not keep walking.
  - If he does, press `release-all` with SF6 focused. A REFramework- or gamepad-based fix will
    be considered.
- **Admin rights (UIPI):** if SF6 runs as admin, SendInput is blocked unless sf6bot also runs
  as admin. This raises an explicit error.

## Idea queued: input-display readback
SF6's Training Mode input display shows the frames each input was held, newest row at the top.
Reading it automatically (template-matching the arrows/icons and digits) would verify sequences
in **game frames**, not wall-clock time. It's a cheap win for M1/M2 timing validation.

## Roadmap
- **M2 — observations and episodes:**
  - HUD detectors: HP, Drive, Super, timer, round result, positions/facing, game state.
  - Confidence and explicit uncertain handling.
  - Checking REFramework state export.
  - Episode/reset logic; a Gymnasium env that accounts for real-time execution.
  - Ranked queue/accept/rematch automation is built but **not used** until the ranked milestone.
  - Opponent-mistake evidence logging.
- **M3 — demonstrations:**
  - Scripted baseline.
  - Demonstration recorder: a low-level keyboard hook, which uses `LLKHF_INJECTED` and our
    `INJECT_TAG` to tell human input from bot input.
  - Behaviour cloning with session-level splits.
- **M4 — RL:** algorithm chosen from measured throughput; macro vs. raw actions; curriculum
  (see the user's spec), ending with the Model Trainer; the opponent-assessment estimator.
- **M5 — evaluation:**
  - Frozen checkpoints, both sides, held-out opponents, with confidence intervals.
  - "Competitive with Master players" is reported separately from "achieved Master rank".
- **Ranked:** a separate milestone. Starts at Diamond+ (see constraints).
